            During my experience in healthcare I specialized in working with
            individuals in a low socioeconomic status, a population that
            struggles with healthcare disparities such as lower access to and
            use of care.

         <Typography className='about-item' variant='body2'>
            Therefore I sought to use technology to help people manage their
            symptoms and improve their overall quality of life. This allowed me
            to see the importance of maintaining a smooth, easy to navigate user
            experience that is accessible to all people.
