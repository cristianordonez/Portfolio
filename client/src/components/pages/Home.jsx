               During my experience in healthcare I specialized in working with
               individuals in a low socioeconomic status, a population that
               struggles with healthcare disparities such as lower access to and
               use of care.

               Therefore I sought to use technology to help people manage their
               symptoms and improve their overall quality of life. This allowed
               me to see the importance of maintaining a smooth, easy to
               navigate user experience that is accessible to all people.
